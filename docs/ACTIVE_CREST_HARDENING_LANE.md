# Active Crest-hardening lane checkpoint

Goal: [Crest-Konvergenz-Härtung](../outputs/AhoiBrowser-Crest-Konvergenz-Haertung-Zielprompt.md).
Lane: `crest-hardening`. Boundaries: [`config/agent-lanes.json`](../config/agent-lanes.json).
Boundary check for the orchestrator:
`python3 tools/check_lane_boundaries.py --all --since <base> --worktree`.

This lane never builds, installs, refreshes the overlay, writes under
`overlay/`, `patches/`, `apps/` or `scripts/`, or stops foreign processes.

## Current state — 25 September 2026

- Lane established; goal, lane config, boundary checker and review committed.
- Base commit for boundary checks: recorded in the lane's first commit message.
- H4: `tools/engine_input_key.py` (key, components, receipt, lookup) with
  `tests/repository/test_engine_input_key.py`; receipt integration handed off
  as 001. Remaining H4 DoD: desktop integration and one regular build receipt
  carrying the key.
- H3: `docs/PERFORMANCE_METHODOLOGY.md`, `tools/perf/` and
  `tests/repository/test_perf_harness.py`; trace events handed off as 002.
  Remaining H3 DoD: one harness run on the installed candidate (leases below).
  Budget verdicts are additionally blocked on the owner-gated reference
  toolchain: `ahoi-dev` is a component build and no `upstream-release`
  control exists yet.
- Next: H5 review/checklist (Crest reference findings in), H1 conformance
  vectors/generator/drift gate, H2 audit.

## Lease requests

A lease is valid only after the resource owner confirms it in their own
checkpoint.

| Resource | Purpose | Requested | Confirmed by owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `installed-app` + `host-quiet` | H3 harness validation run: `startup`, `memory`, `idle` scenarios, 5 runs, disposable profiles, on the installed candidate; about 30 minutes while no build runs and the owner is away | 2026-09-25 | pending |

## Open questions to other lanes

None.
