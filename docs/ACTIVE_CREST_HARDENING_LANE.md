# Active Crest-hardening lane checkpoint

Goal: [Crest-Konvergenz-Härtung](../outputs/AhoiBrowser-Crest-Konvergenz-Haertung-Zielprompt.md).
Lane: `crest-hardening`. Boundaries: [`config/agent-lanes.json`](../config/agent-lanes.json).
Boundary check for the orchestrator:
`python3 tools/check_lane_boundaries.py --all --since <base> --worktree`.

This lane never builds, installs, refreshes the overlay, writes under
`overlay/`, `patches/`, `apps/` or `scripts/`, or stops foreign processes.

## Current state — 25 September 2026

- Lane established; goal, lane config, boundary checker and review committed.
- Base commit for boundary checks: recorded in the lane's first commit message.
- H4: `tools/engine_input_key.py` (key, components, receipt, lookup) with
  `tests/repository/test_engine_input_key.py`; receipt integration handed off
  as 001. Remaining H4 DoD: desktop integration and one regular build receipt
  carrying the key.
- H3: `docs/PERFORMANCE_METHODOLOGY.md`, `tools/perf/` and
  `tests/repository/test_perf_harness.py`; trace events handed off as 002.
  Remaining H3 DoD: one harness run on the installed candidate (leases below).
  Budget verdicts are additionally blocked on the owner-gated reference
  toolchain: `ahoi-dev` is a component build and no `upstream-release`
  control exists yet.
- H6 (new, user request 25 Sep): optional fully isolated Workspaces.
  Analysis `docs/reviews/crest-hardening-2026-09-25-workspace-isolation.md`,
  decision `docs/decisions/0011-optional-isolated-workspace-profiles.md`,
  Master pointer section. Implementation belongs to desktop.
- Handoffs 001 and 002 were integrated by desktop (`2ab7909`, `d425c3b`).
- Rule clarification: `.work/chromium/src` may be read for source analysis
  (a research helper did so on 25 Sep); never written, built or run.
- H5: Crest host reference review and network-silence checklist committed.
  Handoffs 003 (Workspace deletion keeps foreign partition sessions), 004
  (GCM check-in root cause: user policy invalidations), 005 (field-trial
  testing config) and 006 (group before-unload) are ready.
- Pre-existing red test reported in 005: `test_lean_chromium.py` fails at
  `f811604` because `75e20c1` appended `enable_ahoi_ubo_classic` after the
  lean delta and changed the pinned full profiles.
- H6: acceptance catalogue WS-ISO-01..13 handed off as 007 (Master matrix
  lines + registry entries; both files hold uncommitted desktop work).
- Next: H1 conformance vectors/generator/drift gate; H2 audit.

## Lease requests

A lease is valid only after the resource owner confirms it in their own
checkpoint.

| Resource | Purpose | Requested | Confirmed by owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `installed-app` + `host-quiet` | H3 harness validation run: `startup`, `memory`, `idle` scenarios, 5 runs, disposable profiles, on the installed candidate; about 30 minutes while no build runs and the owner is away | 2026-09-25 | pending |

## Open questions to other lanes

None.
